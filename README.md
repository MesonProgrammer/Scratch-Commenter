# Scratch-Commenter
## Requires Internet connection

The script prompts you to comment on a project, user, or studio.
The script sends a request to scratch.mit.edu to see if it is accessible.
It asks for your username and password on scratch.mit.edu to make a session. (IT DOES NOT STORE THE PASSWORD ANYWHERE)
Next, the script asks for the ID of the project or studio, or if you chose 'user', it asks for the username to comment to.

After you have done that, you can comment as much as you like! (or until you're blocked from scratch.mit.edu for sending too many requests)

Thank you for reading the README.md
Have fun! - MesonProgrammer
